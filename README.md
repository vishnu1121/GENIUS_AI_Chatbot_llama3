# GENIUS_AI_Chatbot_llama3
GENIUS is a conversational AI chatbot powered by Llama 3, designed to assist users with tasks, answer questions, and provide intelligent recommendations. It stores conversation history in an SQLite database, dynamically adjusts context length, and offers context-aware responses for seamless interaction.

# Features

1)Maintains a stateful conversation by storing all messages in an SQLite database.  
2)Utilizes Python's `lru_cache` to quickly retrieve recent messages, enhancing performance.  
3)Modifies the conversation context length based on the complexity of user inputs, ensuring relevant and informed responses.  
4)Interfaces with the Llama 3 model via the Ollama API using LangChainâ€™s prompt templating, enabling robust and flexible AI responses.

## Code Structure
main.py: The main script containing the chatbot logic, database setup, and conversation loop.

Prompt Template: The chatbot uses a customizable template to generate responses (Use AI for unique templates). The template is defined in the template variable.

# Database Functions:

setup_database(): Initializes the SQLite database and creates the history table if it doesn't exist.  
get_recent_messages(): Retrieves the most recent messages from the database.  
add_message(): Adds a new message to the database and updates the cache.

# Context Management:  
The ChatbotConfig class manages the context length and adjusts it based on the complexity of user input.

# Customizatio  
Prompt Template: You can modify the template variable in the script to change the chatbot's greeting and capabilities.  
Context Length: Adjust the default_context_length in the ChatbotConfig class to control how much conversation history the chatbot considers.  
Model: You can switch to a different model by changing the model parameter in the OllamaLLM initialization. Choose your own model depending on your specifications of your PC or running host.

# Troubleshooting  
Ollama Server Not Running: Ensure the Ollama server is running and accessible.If not, start the server and try again.  
Database Issues: If the database becomes corrupted or inaccessible, delete the conversation_history.db file and restart the chatbot to create a new database.
