# Workflow of the Program and Chatbot:

# 1. **Program Initialization:**
#    - The program starts by setting up the SQLite database with a table to store conversation history.
#    - The `ChatbotConfig` class is instantiated to manage the dynamic context length of the chatbot based on conversation complexity.

# 2. **Conversation Loop:**
#    - The chatbot prompts the user with "Hi, I'm Genius. How can I help you? Type 'quit' if you want to exit."
#    - The program enters an infinite loop to handle user inputs and responses.

# 3. **User Input Handling:**
#    - The program waits for the user input via `input("You: ")`.
#    - If the user types 'quit', the chatbot ends the conversation and exits the loop.
#    - Otherwise, the user's input is processed.

# 4. **Adjusting Context Length Dynamically:**
#    - The chatbot checks the complexity of the user input using the `adjust_context_based_on_complexity` method.
#    - Based on the length of the user's input, the context length is adjusted:
#       - For complex inputs (longer than 20 words), the context length is increased (e.g., 10 messages).
#       - For medium complexity (10-20 words), the context length is set to 7.
#       - For simple inputs (less than 10 words), the default context length is used (e.g., 5).

# 5. **Adding User Message to Database:**
#    - The user's message is added to the SQLite database and the cache is updated.
#    - The `add_message` function stores the user's message and clears the cache to refresh the recent message list.

# 6. **Retrieving Recent Messages:**
#    - The program queries the SQLite database to fetch the most recent messages based on the adjusted context length.
#    - It retrieves a limited number of recent messages as per the `chatbot_config.current_context_length` (which is dynamically set).

# 7. **Formatting Context for Response:**
#    - The recent messages are formatted into a string that will be used as the context for generating a response. This ensures the chatbot uses the relevant context to provide a better, more coherent answer.

# 8. **Generating Response with Llama 3:**
#    - The `chain.invoke()` function is called with the formatted context and the user's input to generate a response using the Llama 3 model.
#    - The response from the model is then printed to the screen as the chatbot's reply.

# 9. **Adding Chatbot Response to Database:**
#    - The chatbot's response is stored in the SQLite database.
#    - The response is also cached to allow quick retrieval of recent conversation history.

# 10. **Error Handling:**
#    - If any errors occur (such as issues connecting to the Ollama server), an error message is displayed, and the loop ends.

# 11. **Graceful Exit:**
#    - When the user types 'quit', the program prints "Goodbye! Have a great day!" and closes the database connection before exiting.

# 12. **End of Conversation:**
#    - The program gracefully exits after the conversation ends, ensuring that the database connection is properly closed.
